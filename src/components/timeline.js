								<p className="timeline__content-desc">
									The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in
									1960. With a line-up comprising John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
									George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they are regarded as the most
									influential band of all time.[1] The group were integral to
									the evolution of pop music into an art form and to the
									development of the counterculture of the 1960s.[2] Their
									sound, rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll,
									incorporated elements of classNameical music and traditional
									pop in innovative ways. They also pioneered recording
									techniques and explored music styles ranging from ballads and
									Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. As they continued
									to draw influences from a variety of cultural sources, their
									musical and lyrical sophistication grew, and they came to be
									seen as embodying the era's socio-cultural movements.

								<p className="timeline__content-desc">
									In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a
									skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High
									School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the
									Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after
									discovering that a respected local group was already using the
									other name.[3] Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as
									a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that
									July.[4] In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George
									Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned
									for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon
									initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a
									month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting
									(arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of
									the instrumental song "Raunchy" on the upper deck of a
									Liverpool bus,[5] and they enlisted him as their lead
									guitarist.[6][7]

								<p className="timeline__content-desc">
									By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the
									group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of
									Art.[8] The three guitarists, billing themselves at least
									three times as Johnny and the Moondogs,[9] were playing rock
									and roll whenever they could find a drummer.[10] Lennon's art
									school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his
									paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined
									in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the
									band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the
									Crickets.[11][12] They used this name until May, when they
									became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of
									Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow
									Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had
									refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the
									middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.[13]

									In 1961, during their second Hamburg engagement, Kirchherr cut
									Sutcliffe's hair in the "exi" (existentialist) style, later
									adopted by the other Beatles.[24][25] When Sutcliffe decided
									to leave the band early that year and resume his art studies
									in Germany, McCartney took up the bass.[26] Producer Bert
									Kaempfert contracted what was now a four-piece group until
									June 1962, and he used them as Tony Sheridan's backing band on
									a series of recordings for Polydor Records.[12][27] As part of
									the sessions, the Beatles were signed to Polydor for one
									year.[28] Credited to "Tony Sheridan & the Beat Brothers", the
									single "My Bonnie", recorded in June 1961 and released four
									months later, reached number 32 on the Musikmarkt chart.[29]

									Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place
									at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962.[38]
									Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor
									drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his
									place.[39] Already contemplating Best's dismissal,[40] the
									Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left
									Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them.[38] A 4 September
									session at EMI yielded a recording of "Love Me Do" featuring
									Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy
									White for the band's third session a week later, which
									produced recordings of "Love Me Do", "Please Please Me" and
									"P.S. I Love You".[38]

									On 11 February 1963, the Beatles recorded ten songs during a

									The album was supplemented by the four tracks already released
									on their first two singles. Martin originally considered
									recording the Beatles' debut LP live at The Cavern Club, but
									after deciding that the building's acoustics were inadequate,
									he elected to simulate a "live" album with minimal production
									in "a single marathon session at Abbey Road".[51]

									In early 1965, following a dinner with Lennon, Harrison and

									to their coffee.[124] Lennon described the experience: "It was
									just terrifying, but it was fantastic. I was pretty stunned
									for a month or two."[125] He and Harrison subsequently became
									regular users of the drug, joined by Starr on at least one
									occasion. Harrison's use of psychedelic drugs encouraged his
									path to meditation and Hinduism. He commented: "For me, it was
									like a flash. The first time I had acid, it just opened up
									something in my head that was inside of me, and I realized a
									lot of things. I didn't learn them because I already knew
									them, but that happened to be the key that opened the door to
